There are three treatments for the freezing experiment - 
	1. Control
	2. Freeze
	3. Drought  & Freeze
Did SLA, Chlorophyll meter measurements, and duration of vegetative risk

Buds Sheet -
	1. Control
	2. Freeze
Monitored each individual bud, SLA, chlorophyll meter measurements and eventually Ciras-2 
	Received spider mite treatment three times, may result in defoliation so may need to postpone 	remaining traits data till next year…

TX A is control
TX B put in growth chamber at -3 degC for 24hrs between budburst and leafout
TX C was put under drought conditions prior to freeze
